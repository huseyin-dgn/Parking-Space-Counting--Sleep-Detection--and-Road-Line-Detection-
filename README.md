Sleep Detection, Parking Space Counting, and Lane Tracking System
This project implements three important computer vision applications using OpenCV: Sleep Detection, Parking Space Counting, and Lane Tracking.

  Contents:

Sleep Detection: Detects sleep based on eye blinking patterns.
Parking Space Counting: Detects and counts available parking spaces in uploaded video footage.
Lane Tracking: Tracks road lane markings for navigation.
Technologies Used

Python: Primary programming language
OpenCV: Library for image processing and computer vision applications
NumPy: Used for mathematical operations and data processing
How It Works

Sleep Detection: The algorithm analyzes eye blinking patterns to detect sleep states.
Parking Space Counting: The system detects parking spaces in video files and counts available spots.
Lane Tracking: Lane markings are detected in video footage to ensure proper navigation on roads.

  Requirementsv :
Python 3.x
OpenCV
NumPy

  Installation :
To run the project, clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies:

git clone <repository_url>
